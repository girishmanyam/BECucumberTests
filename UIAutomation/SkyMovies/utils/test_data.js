Benefiting from a sharp script, genuine spark between the two leads and fine support from Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins, the director of Easy A makes it two cool and sassy sex-coms in a row.",

  "review": "While showing a healthy disregard for romantic comedies, director Will Gluck’s follow-up to his equally raunchy sleeper smash Easy A is essentially When Harry Met Sally for the i-generation.\nYet a shared disdain for Hollywood laugh-and-love stories is one of the things that unites romantically disillusioned New Yorker Jamie (Black Swan's Kunis) and online marketing genius Dylan (Timberlake).\nThis they discover when corporate recruiter Jamie lures Dylan from LA to the Big Apple with a top job at GQ magazine. It’s the beginning of a beautiful friendship. However, since both have just been dumped, commitment is a four-letter word.\nSex, on the other hand, is not. So after agreeing to keep their relationship purely non-platonic, the quick-bantering pair are soon at it like bunnies. Ridiculously cute-bunned bunnies.\nIt’s all good, dirty fun... until they decide to start dating again and all those pesky, life-affirming, heart-wrenching, unpredictable feelings begin to kick in.\nIt doesn’t take a degree in Freudian theory to see where it’s all heading. But on top of the constantly engaging snap, crackle and pop between Timberlake and Kunis, there are plenty of other diversions on the way.\nClarkson and Harrelson are typically great value as, respectively, Jamie’s super-liberal mum and GQ’s super-gay sports editor, while Kunis' Forgetting Sarah Marshall costar Jason Segel, Andy 'Hot Rod' Samberg and Easy A’s Emma Stone also pitch in with game cameos (though the presence of snowboard star Shaun White will be lost on anyone unfamiliar with the US winter sports scene).\nAnd though the script never loses its saltiness, issues are put in more serious perspective when Dylan takes Jamie to meet his Alzheimer’s afflicted father (Jenkins; faultless) and big sister Annie (Jenna Elfman; ditto) at their beach home in LA. It’s these latter two who give the film its soul.\nThat said, we could probably live without Annie’s insipid, magic-obsessed son. Especially since we have to live without Jamie and Dylan's respective Asian friends who appear at the start but, like any other pals they may have, are entirely absent for the rest of the film.\nThe reliance on app-related gags and plot devices may also begin to grate, but when they’re done well – as in the two ‘flash mob’ dance scenes – they definitely add to the sugar rush.\nYou could be forgiven for presuming that one year's No Strings Attached comedy will be much like another. But Friends With Benefits comes with one key difference: it’s funny."

  "review": "Told from the future, an animated prologue informs us that after a lengthy conflict, a vampire uprising was quashed by warrior priests and humankind is now safely ensconced in walled citadels ruled by the all-conquering religious regime.\nUnfortunately, though chief monsignor Christopher Plummer denies their existence, the bloodsucking blighters are thriving in the wastelands outside.\nThis comes to the attention of righteous brother Paul Bettany when lawman Hicks (Gigandet) arrives from beyond the walls to tell him that his farmer brother (True Blood star Stephen Moyer in a little casting jape) has been attacked and his niece Lucy (Collins) has been abducted by slimy, eyeless marauders.\nBlood being thicker than holy water, ‘Priest’ is compelled to break his vow of peace. At the price of excommunication, he resolves to go forth, prove Pope Plummer wrong and help Hicks get the girl.\nNaturally, there are many obstacles in their path, from Brad Dourif’s sneaky charlatan and the vampires' barely human ‘familiars’ (imagine a sickly-looking Right Said Fred tribute band) to what appears to be an angry cross between a blind Rottweiler and a walrus.\nLuckily, they find an ally in Maggie Q's combative clergywoman who was sent by Plummer to bring her old colleague back. Thanks to their shared history, she proves sympathetic to his cause.\nAfter much razzing across the desert on their Tron-style jetbikes, the trio realise that the kidnap was just part of a revenge plan dreamed up by fallen Christian soldier Karl Urban, who fell into vampire clutches in the opening scene.\nSo expect an almighty showdown as Legion director Stewart takes his cue from The Matrix and Mad Max 2 to bring this post-apocalyptic crusade home.",

Benefiting from a sharp script, genuine spark between the two leads and fine support from Woody Harrelson, Patricia Clarkson and Richard Jenkins, the director of Easy A makes it two cool and sassy sex-coms in a row.",

  "review": "While showing a healthy disregard for romantic comedies, director Will Gluck’s follow-up to his equally raunchy sleeper smash Easy A is essentially When Harry Met Sally for the i-generation.\nYet a shared disdain for Hollywood laugh-and-love stories is one of the things that unites romantically disillusioned New Yorker Jamie (Black Swan's Kunis) and online marketing genius Dylan (Timberlake).\nThis they discover when corporate recruiter Jamie lures Dylan from LA to the Big Apple with a top job at GQ magazine. It’s the beginning of a beautiful friendship. However, since both have just been dumped, commitment is a four-letter word.\nSex, on the other hand, is not. So after agreeing to keep their relationship purely non-platonic, the quick-bantering pair are soon at it like bunnies. Ridiculously cute-bunned bunnies.\nIt’s all good, dirty fun... until they decide to start dating again and all those pesky, life-affirming, heart-wrenching, unpredictable feelings begin to kick in.\nIt doesn’t take a degree in Freudian theory to see where it’s all heading. But on top of the constantly engaging snap, crackle and pop between Timberlake and Kunis, there are plenty of other diversions on the way.\nClarkson and Harrelson are typically great value as, respectively, Jamie’s super-liberal mum and GQ’s super-gay sports editor, while Kunis' Forgetting Sarah Marshall costar Jason Segel, Andy 'Hot Rod' Samberg and Easy A’s Emma Stone also pitch in with game cameos (though the presence of snowboard star Shaun White will be lost on anyone unfamiliar with the US winter sports scene).\nAnd though the script never loses its saltiness, issues are put in more serious perspective when Dylan takes Jamie to meet his Alzheimer’s afflicted father (Jenkins; faultless) and big sister Annie (Jenna Elfman; ditto) at their beach home in LA. It’s these latter two who give the film its soul.\nThat said, we could probably live without Annie’s insipid, magic-obsessed son. Especially since we have to live without Jamie and Dylan's respective Asian friends who appear at the start but, like any other pals they may have, are entirely absent for the rest of the film.\nThe reliance on app-related gags and plot devices may also begin to grate, but when they’re done well – as in the two ‘flash mob’ dance scenes – they definitely add to the sugar rush.\nYou could be forgiven for presuming that one year's No Strings Attached comedy will be much like another. But Friends With Benefits comes with one key difference: it’s funny."

  "review": "Few films could offer the twin cinematic glories of Michael Caine riding a giant bee and The Rock flicking berries off his bulging pecs.\nYet this winning family affair boasts both... as well as Luis Guzman tumbling into a gigantic gooey egg and an active volcano that spews out molten gold.\nCheekily mashing up loose takes on the legends of Jules Verne, Robert Louis Stevenson and even Jonathan Swift, director Brad Peyton carries on the good work accomplished in 2008’s Journey To The Center of the Earth.\nJosh Hutcherson’s back as Sean and this time he’s joined by stepdad Hank (Johnson) grandpa Alexander (Caine, channelling Colonel Sanders), zany helicopter pilot Gabato (Guzman) and his foxy daughter Kailani (Hudgens).\nThey’ve washed up on the Mysterious Island after following a code transmitted by shipwrecked Alexander and deciphered by Sean and Hank, who just happens to have worked in comms in the American Navy.\nIt would be an island paradise... if it wasn’t inhabited by giant centipedes, huge bee-eating Needletails and the fact the water level is rising, threatening to drown the island... which is also home to the lost city of Atlantis.\nAttractively free of cynicism, this is appealing Saturday matinee fare boosted by the ever-reliable Johnson, who’s game enough to launch into a cheesy version of What A Wonderful World on a ukelele.\nThe effects – while impressive – aren’t designed to send smaller sprogs sprinting for the exit; just check out the chase set-piece on giant bumblebees and the panicky retreat from an incensed mammoth lizard.\nUltimately, it’s a good-old fashioned action romp – there’s no mystery about it."
